# Lönn Presets

Save and edit entity/trigger presets for Lönn that appear in the placements menu for easy access, and set up Preset Groups to conveniently swap out presets and favorites.

This plugin is a Lönn port of the [Ahorn Preset Tool](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6978) and [Ahorn Favorites Saver](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6983) mods.

## Using Presets

To **create** a preset:

- Select the **Presets** tool, and the layer you want
- Click on the entity / trigger you want to make a preset of
- Name the preset and edit properties
- Save changes and go back to the placement tool

To **rename/edit/delete** a preset, just click on it in the presets list with the **Presets** tool selected.

Presets will be placeable from the placement tool. If your preset does not appear, change layer on the placement tool to refresh the list.

## Using Preset / Favorites Groups

Select the **Presets** tool, and select the **Preset Groups** option.

The first time you use the plugin, the global group will be selected. All presets and favorites made in the global group will apply to every other preset group.

To **create** a new group, select the "New..." option, name your group, and add it to the list.

To **rename/delete** a group, select it and then click anywhere on the map to open the settings window. This will not work for the global group.

Presets from the global group cannot be renamed or deleted from any other group, but their properties can be changed.

The plugin will remember the name of the preset group you had open for a specific map, so you can conveniently use a unique preset group for each map you work on!
